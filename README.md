# Google Ads Scripts by Kurvin


Hey GitHub!

I've finally made my debut on GitHub. It's great to be here.

I am currently pursuing the Google Ads Automations space, starting with Google Ads Scripts.

I've been in this space since January 2021.

It has had it's ups and downs like everything else, but I've learnt a lot, 
and I've seen there's a lot of value to provide to those it will benefit

# The Purpose of this Repository

I have created this repository to display some of my work so far.

It gives me a more accessible store of my portfolio.

I hope my scripts provide:
1. Inspiration, 
2. Are useful to others and,
3. Lead to collaborative opportunities!

Please take a look around.
